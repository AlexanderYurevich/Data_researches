<br>In my research I:
- Do data organization and preparation
- Analyze dependencies and correlation between metrics
- Build visualization to make my research easier to understand
- Apply Shapiro–Wilk test and Mann–Whitney U test for statistical hypothesis testing
- Summarize the findings of the research and make recommendations
